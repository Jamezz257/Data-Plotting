All my code is in python unless explicitely stated otherwise. All code is my own unless titled/stated otherwise (i.e chatgpt generated code will be titled accordingly, and in all cases I will have attempted my own
version of the code first and not edited the gpt generated, purely for comparisons). The purpose of the uploads is simply to show potential employers what I know. The code might not be perfect, efficient, or even work,
but hopefully as I spend more time working with and analysing data I will become more fluent with plotting and analysing techniques.
